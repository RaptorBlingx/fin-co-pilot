## 🎯 Item-Level Tracking Flow

### After User Confirms Receipt:

**1. Transaction Saved:**
```dart
Transaction {
  id: "tx_123",
  amount: 50.01,
  category: "Groceries",
  merchant: "Costco",
  date: 2025-10-17,
  items_count: 15,
  has_items: true
}
```

**2. Individual Items Saved (via Item Tracker Agent):**
```dart
users/{userId}/tracked_items/
  ├─ {item1_id}
  │   ├─ transaction_id: "tx_123"
  │   ├─ item_name: "Organic Milk 1 Gal"
  │   ├─ normalized_name: "organic milk 1 gal"
  │   ├─ category: "Dairy"
  │   ├─ quantity: 1
  │   ├─ unit_price: 4.99
  │   ├─ total_price: 4.99
  │   ├─ merchant: "Costco"
  │   └─ purchase_date: 2025-10-17
  │
  ├─ {item2_id}
  │   ├─ item_name: "Eggs Large 12ct"
  │   ├─ quantity: 2
  │   ├─ unit_price: 3.49
  │   └─ ... etc
```

**3. Item Profiles Updated:**
```dart
users/{userId}/item_profiles/
  └─ "organic_milk_1_gal"
      ├─ purchase_count: 12
      ├─ average_price: 4.85
      ├─ last_price: 4.99
      ├─ last_merchant: "Costco"
      ├─ price_history: [
      │   {date: "2025-10-17", price: 4.99, merchant: "Costco"},
      │   {date: "2025-10-13", price: 4.79, merchant: "Safeway"},
      │   {date: "2025-10-09", price: 5.29, merchant: "Target"}
      │ ]
      └─ frequency_days: 4 (buys every 4 days)
```

**4. Pattern Learning:**
```dart
users/{userId}/spending_patterns/
  └─ "Groceries"
      ├─ transaction_count: 24
      ├─ total_spent: 1247.50
      └─ average_per_trip: 51.98
