## 🎯 The 7 Agents

### **Agent 1: Orchestrator** ⭐ The Brain
**File:** `lib/services/agents/orchestrator_agent.dart`

**Purpose:** Routes requests to specialist agents and synthesizes their responses

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Coordinates all specialist agents
- ✅ Manages conversation flow
- ✅ Generates natural conversational responses
- ✅ Combines insights from multiple agents
- ✅ Fault-tolerant coordination

**Flow:**
```
1. Receives user message
2. Calls Extractor Agent → get extracted data
3. Calls Validator Agent → check completeness
4. Calls Context Agent → get suggestions
5. Generates conversational response
6. Returns unified OrchestratorResponse
```

---

### **Agent 2: Extractor** 🔍 Data Parser
**File:** `lib/services/agents/extractor_agent.dart`

**Purpose:** Specialized in parsing natural language and extracting transaction fields

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Extracts amount in multiple formats ($5, 5 dollars, 5.50)
- ✅ Identifies items from keywords
- ✅ Infers categories from context
- ✅ Extracts merchant names
- ✅ Handles common merchants (Starbucks, McDonald's, etc.)
- ✅ Fallback to regex when AI fails
- ✅ Confidence scoring

**Example Extractions:**
```
"Coffee $5" → {amount: 5.0, item: "Coffee", category: "Coffee"}
"Lunch at McDonald's" → {item: "Lunch", merchant: "McDonald's", category: "Dining"}
"47 dollars for groceries at Costco" → {amount: 47.0, item: "Groceries", merchant: "Costco", category: "Groceries"}
```

---

### **Agent 3: Validator** ✅ Quality Control
**File:** `lib/services/agents/validator_agent.dart`

**Purpose:** Validates required fields and generates smart follow-up questions

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Checks all required fields (amount, item, category)
- ✅ Identifies missing fields
- ✅ Generates contextual follow-up questions
- ✅ Acknowledges what user provided
- ✅ Prioritizes missing fields

**Example Questions:**
```
Missing amount, have item:
  "Got your Coffee! How much did it cost? 💰"

Missing item, have amount:
  "What did you buy for $5? 🛍️"

Missing multiple:
  "What did you buy and how much did it cost?"
```

---

### **Agent 4: Context** 🎯 THE DIFFERENTIATOR
**File:** `lib/services/agents/context_agent.dart`

**Purpose:** Analyzes transaction richness and suggests receipt uploads

**THIS IS THE MOAT** - Encourages rich context that enables premium features

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Calculates context richness (minimal → very_high)
- ✅ Suggests receipt uploads for broad categories
- ✅ Identifies categories that benefit from itemization
- ✅ Encourages optional fields naturally
- ✅ Prioritizes merchant as most valuable optional field

**Richness Levels:**
```
minimal:    0-2 fields (incomplete)
low:        3 fields (required only)
medium:     4 fields (required + 1 optional)
high:       5 fields (required + 2 optional)
very_high:  6+ fields (comprehensive)
```

**Receipt Upload Suggestions:**
```
Categories that benefit:
- Groceries (track individual items)
- Shopping (multiple items)
- Dining (meal breakdown)
- Health (medications)
- Bills (line items)

Example: "Want to snap a photo of your receipt? I can break down the items for smarter tracking! 📸"
```

## 🔄 How the Agent Swarm Works

### Complete Flow Example: "Coffee"

```
1. USER TYPES: "Coffee"
   │
   ▼
2. RobustAIService receives message
   ├─ useAgentSwarm = true
   └─ Routes to Orchestrator
   │
   ▼
3. Orchestrator coordinates agents:
   │
   ├─ Calls EXTRACTOR Agent
   │   ├─ Analyzes "Coffee"
   │   ├─ Extracts: item="Coffee", category="Coffee"
   │   └─ Returns: ExtractionResult(confidence=0.66)
   │
   ├─ Calls VALIDATOR Agent
   │   ├─ Checks required fields
   │   ├─ Missing: amount
   │   ├─ Generates question: "Got your coffee! How much did it cost? 💰"
   │   └─ Returns: ValidationResult(isComplete=false)
   │
   ├─ Calls CONTEXT Agent
   │   ├─ Calculates richness: "low" (only 2/3 required)
   │   ├─ shouldSuggestReceipt: false (not a broad category)
   │   └─ Returns: ContextResult(richnessLevel="low")
   │
   └─ Generates conversational response
       └─ "Got your coffee! ☕ How much did it cost?"
   │
   ▼
4. Returns to UI

## 🎮 Usage

### Enabling Agent Swarm (Default):
```dart
final aiService = RobustAIService(useAgentSwarm: true);
```

### Disabling (Fallback to Single Model):
```dart
final aiService = RobustAIService(useAgentSwarm: false);
```

### In Production:
```dart
// Already integrated in conversation_ai_service.dart
final conversationAIServiceProvider = Provider<ConversationAIService>((ref) {
  final robustAI = RobustAIService(); // useAgentSwarm defaults to true
  return ConversationAIService(robustAI);
});
```
