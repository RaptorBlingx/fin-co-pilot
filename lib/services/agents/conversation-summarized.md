This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all technical details, user requests, and work completed.

**User's Initial Request:**
The user started by asking to continue Phase B implementation of the Fin Co-Pilot redesign, with Phase A (foundation) already complete. The main blocker was that the conversational Add Transaction feature wasn't working - showing debug text instead of proper chat UI, and transaction preview cards weren't appearing. The core issue was using regex parsing instead of calling Gemini AI properly.

**First Major Task - Implementing RobustAIService:**
I created a new RobustAIService that:
- Properly integrates with Firebase Vertex AI using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Uses structured system prompts enforcing required field collection (amount, item, category)
- Returns structured JSON responses
- Has intelligent fallback to regex extraction

**Second Major Task - Agent Swarm Architecture:**
After the basic AI was working, the user said "great, it is working, let's do the next steps". I then implemented all 7 core transaction agents:
1. Orchestrator Agent - coordinates all specialist agents
2. Extractor Agent - specialized data extraction
3. Validator Agent - field validation and follow-up questions
4. Context Agent - suggests receipt uploads (THE DIFFERENTIATOR)
5. Receipt Agent - OCR from photos using Gemini Pro Vision
6. Item Tracker Agent - tracks individual items for price intelligence
7. Pattern Learner Agent - learns user patterns

**Third Major Task - Receipt Camera Feature:**
The user tested the app, typed "Groceries $47", and the AI suggested receipt upload. However, the camera button showed "coming soon". The user said "I think it is the time to enable it" and requested that "after enabling it and after user take the picture, the AI must view the items for the user to confirm or edit before submit".

I implemented:
- Camera/gallery picker integration
- Receipt processing with Gemini Pro Vision
- Receipt Review Screen with beautiful UI showing all extracted items
- Edit functionality (delete items, edit merchant)
- Item Tracker Agent integration to save items to Firestore

**Fourth Major Task - Gemini Model Update:**
The user pointed out "you used Gemini 1.5 model which is retired model you must update all the models to Gemini 2.5 family". I:
- Updated Receipt Agent to use Gemini 2.5 Pro (for vision)
- Verified all other agents were already using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Connected Item Tracker Agent to actually save items when receipts are confirmed

**Current Task - Price Intelligence Dashboard:**
After completing the model updates and item tracking connection, the user said "let's do the next steps 🚀". The next steps were explicitly:
1. Load real item data from Firestore in Price Intelligence Dashboard
2. Add price trend charts using fl_chart
3. Implement purchase predictions

I was in the middle of implementing step 1 (loading real data) when the summary was requested. Specifically, I had:
- Added `getAllTrackedItems()` method to ItemTrackerAgent
- Added `calculatePurchaseFrequency()` and `predictNextPurchase()` methods
- Updated ItemPurchaseHistory class to include category, dates, etc.
- Modified Price Intelligence Screen to load real data from Firestore
- Updated display methods to show real tracked items with predictions
- Was in the middle of updating the _showItemDetail method when interrupted

**Key Files Modified/Created:**
- lib/features/add_transaction/services/robust_ai_service.dart (created)
- lib/services/agents/ (7 agent files created)
- lib/features/add_transaction/presentation/receipt_review_screen.dart (created)
- lib/features/add_transaction/presentation/add_transaction_screen.dart (modified for camera)
- lib/services/agents/receipt_agent.dart (updated to Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- lib/services/agents/item_tracker_agent.dart (added methods for loading data, predictions)
- lib/features/price_intelligence/presentation/price_intelligence_screen.dart (created and being updated)

**Errors Encountered:**
- Tool use error when trying to edit add_transaction_screen.dart without reading it first - fixed by reading the file first
- Unused import warnings - fixed by removing dart:convert from orchestrator_agent.dart

Summary:
## 1. Primary Request and Intent:

The user's journey through this conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: Continue Phase B implementation of Fin Co-Pilot redesign. Fix the conversational Add Transaction feature which was showing debug text instead of proper chat UI and not displaying transaction preview cards. The core issue was using regex parsing instead of properly calling Gemini AI.

2. **Second Request**: After confirming the AI integration worked, user said "great, it is working, let's do the next steps" - requesting implementation of the 7-agent swarm architecture as designed in the project charter.

3. **Third Request**: After testing the app and seeing "Groceries $47" trigger a receipt upload suggestion, the user noted the camera showed "coming soon in step 5.7" and said "I think it is the time to enable it". User specifically requested: "after enabling it and after user take the picture, the AI must view the items for the user to confirm or edit before submit"

4. **Fourth Request**: User identified critical issue: "you used Gemini 1.5 model which is retired model you must update all the models to Gemini 2.5 family" and requested to "search web to get updated info about those models." Also specified next steps: "Connect Item Tracker Agent - Save items to Firestore, Price Intelligence Dashboard - Show user their trends, Purchase Predictions - You need milk in 2 days"

5. **Current Request**: User said "let's do the next steps 🚀" referring to implementing the price intelligence features with real data loading, charts, and predictions.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts:

- **Gemini 2.5 Family Models**:
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash: High-throughput, best price/performance, 1M token context, thinking capabilities
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro: Superior vision/multimodal, 90%+ accuracy on complex extraction, tops LMArena leaderboard
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite: Fastest/cheapest in the family

- **Agent Swarm Architecture**: Specialized agents each handling one task (extraction, validation, context analysis, etc.) coordinated by an orchestrator

- **Firebase Vertex AI**: Integration method for accessing Gemini models without API keys

- **Item-Level Tracking**: Competitive moat - tracking individual items from receipts, not just transaction totals

- **Firestore Database Structure**:
  - `users/{userId}/tracked_items/` - Individual item purchases
  - `users/{userId}/item_profiles/` - Aggregated history per item
  - `users/{userId}/spending_patterns/` - Category-level patterns
  - `users/{userId}/merchant_preferences/` - Favorite stores

- **Purchase Prediction Algorithm**: Calculates average days between purchases to predict when user will need items next

- **Price Trend Analysis**: Compares oldest vs latest price to determine if item is increasing/decreasing/stable

- **Flutter Riverpod**: State management framework used throughout

- **ImagePicker**: For camera/gallery integration

- **fl_chart**: Charting library (referenced but not yet implemented)

## 3. Files and Code Sections:

### lib/features/add_transaction/services/robust_ai_service.dart (CREATED)
**Purpose**: Core AI service that properly integrates with Gemini 2.5 Flash for conversational transaction logging

**Key Code**:
```dart
class RobustAIService {
  late final GenerativeModel _model;
  final List<String> _conversationHistory = [];
  late final OrchestratorAgent _orchestrator;
  final bool _useAgentSwarm;

  RobustAIService({bool useAgentSwarm = true}) : _useAgentSwarm = useAgentSwarm {
    _model = FirebaseVertexAI.instance.generativeModel(
      model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
    );
    if (_useAgentSwarm) {
      _extractor = ExtractorAgent();
      _validator = ValidatorAgent();
      _context = ContextAgent();
      _orchestrator = OrchestratorAgent(/*...*/);
    }
  }

  Future<AIResponse> processMessage({
    required String userMessage,
    required TransactionData currentData,
  }) async {
    if (_useAgentSwarm) {
      aiResponse = await _processWithAgentSwarm(/*...*/);
    } else {
      aiResponse = await _processWithSingleModel(/*...*/);
    }
  }
}
```

### lib/services/agents/orchestrator_agent.dart (CREATED)
**Purpose**: Agent 1 - Coordinates all specialist agents and synthesizes responses

**Key Code**:
```dart
class OrchestratorAgent {
  Future<OrchestratorResponse> orchestrate({
    required String userMessage,
    required TransactionData currentData,
    required List<String> conversationHistory,
  }) async {
    // Step 1: Extract data using Extractor Agent
    final extractionResult = await _extractorAgent.extract(/*...*/);
    
    // Step 2: Validate completeness using Validator Agent
    final validationResult = await _validatorAgent.validate(/*...*/);
    
    // Step 3: Get contextual suggestions using Context Agent
    final contextResult = await _contextAgent.analyzeContext(/*...*/);
    
    // Step 4: Generate conversational response
    final conversationalResponse = await _generateConversationalResponse(/*...*/);
  }
}
```

### lib/services/agents/receipt_agent.dart (CREATED, THEN UPDATED)
**Purpose**: Agent 5 - OCR from receipt photos, THE MOAT feature

**Critical Update**: Changed from retired Gemini 1.5 Pro to Gemini 2.5 Pro
```dart
ReceiptAgent() {
  // Use Gemini 2.5 Pro for advanced vision and multimodal capabilities
  // Gemini 2.5 Pro: 1M token context, native multimodality, superior accuracy
  _visionModel = FirebaseVertexAI.instance.generativeModel(
    model: 'gemini-2.5-pro',  // CHANGED FROM gemini-1.5-pro
  );
}

Future<ReceiptExtractionResult> extractFromReceipt({
  required Uint8List imageBytes,
}) async {
  final response = await _visionModel.generateContent([
    Content.multi([
      TextPart(prompt),
      InlineDataPart('image/jpeg', imageBytes),
    ])
  ]);
}
```

### lib/features/add_transaction/presentation/receipt_review_screen.dart (CREATED)
**Purpose**: Beautiful UI for users to review and edit extracted receipt items before saving

**Key Features**:
- Receipt info card showing merchant, date, totals
- List of all extracted items with category icons (🥛 Dairy, 🥬 Produce, etc.)
- Edit mode to delete items or edit merchant name
- Automatic total recalculation
- Confirm/Cancel buttons

**Key Code**:
```dart
class ReceiptReviewScreen extends ConsumerStatefulWidget {
  final ReceiptExtractionResult receiptData;
  
  Widget _buildReceiptInfoCard() {
    return Container(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // Merchant, date display
          Row(/* merchant info */),
          // Totals: Items, Subtotal, Tax, Total
          Row(
            children: [
              Column(/* Items count */),
              Column(/* Subtotal */),
              Column(/* Tax */),
              Column(/* Total with SF Mono font */),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
  
  void _confirmAndSave() {
    final updatedReceiptData = ReceiptExtractionResult(
      merchant: _merchantController.text.trim(),
      items: _items, // After user edits
      subtotal: _calculateSubtotal(),
      total: _calculateTotal(),
    );
    Navigator.pop(context, updatedReceiptData);
  }
}
```

### lib/features/add_transaction/presentation/add_transaction_screen.dart (MODIFIED)
**Purpose**: Updated to handle camera integration and receipt processing

**Key Changes**:

  final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
  
  // Save items using Item Tracker Agent
  if (receipt.items.isNotEmpty) {
    final itemTracker = ItemTrackerAgent();
    await itemTracker.trackItems(
      userId: user.uid,
      transactionId: tempTransactionId,
      items: receipt.items,
      purchaseDate: receipt.date ?? DateTime.now(),
      merchant: receipt.merchant,
    );

  _handleSendMessage(summary);
  
  // Show success notification
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(content: Text('Receipt processed! $itemCount items tracked 📊')),
  );
}
```

### lib/services/agents/item_tracker_agent.dart (MODIFIED - MOST RECENT WORK)
**Purpose**: Agent 6 - Tracks individual items, calculates price trends, predicts purchases

**Recent Additions**:
```dart
/// Get all tracked items for a user (for dashboard)
Future<List<ItemPurchaseHistory>> getAllTrackedItems({
  required String userId,
  int limit = 50,
}) async {
  final profilesSnapshot = await _firestore
      .collection('users')
      .doc(userId)
      .collection('item_profiles')
      .orderBy('last_purchase_date', descending: true)
      .limit(limit)
      .get();

  final items = <ItemPurchaseHistory>[];
  for (final doc in profilesSnapshot.docs) {
    final data = doc.data();
    items.add(ItemPurchaseHistory(
      itemName: data['item_name'] ?? 'Unknown',
      purchaseCount: data['purchase_count'] ?? 0,
      averagePrice: (data['average_price'] as num?)?.toDouble() ?? 0.0,
      lastPrice: (data['last_price'] as num?)?.toDouble() ?? 0.0,
      category: data['category'] ?? 'Other',
      firstPurchaseDate: (data['first_purchase_date'] as Timestamp?)?.toDate(),
      lastPurchaseDate: (data['last_purchase_date'] as Timestamp?)?.toDate(),
      purchases: /* price history list */,
    ));
  }
  return items;
}

/// Calculate purchase frequency for predictions
int? calculatePurchaseFrequency(List<ItemPurchase> purchases) {
  if (purchases.length < 2) return null;
  final sorted = purchases.toList()..sort((a, b) => a.date.compareTo(b.date));
  
  // Calculate days between purchases
  final intervals = <int>[];
  for (int i = 1; i < sorted.length; i++) {
    final days = sorted[i].date.difference(sorted[i - 1].date).inDays;
    if (days > 0) intervals.add(days);
  }
  
  // Return average interval
  final sum = intervals.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  return (sum / intervals.length).round();
}

/// Predict next purchase date
DateTime? predictNextPurchase(ItemPurchaseHistory item) {
  final frequency = calculatePurchaseFrequency(item.purchases);
  if (frequency == null || item.lastPurchaseDate == null) return null;
  return item.lastPurchaseDate!.add(Duration(days: frequency));
}

// Updated ItemPurchaseHistory class
class ItemPurchaseHistory {
  final String itemName;
  final int purchaseCount;
  final double averagePrice;
  final double lastPrice;

  final List<ItemPurchase> purchases;
  
  ItemPurchaseHistory({/* updated constructor */});
}
```

### lib/features/price_intelligence/presentation/price_intelligence_screen.dart (CREATED, BEING UPDATED)
**Purpose**: Dashboard to display tracked items, price trends, and purchase predictions

**Current Implementation Status** (work in progress when summary requested):
```dart
class _PriceIntelligenceScreenState extends ConsumerState<PriceIntelligenceScreen> {
  final ItemTrackerAgent _itemTracker = ItemTrackerAgent();
  List<ItemPurchaseHistory> _trackedItems = [];
  bool _isLoading = true;
  double _totalSavings = 0.0;

  Future<void> _loadTrackedItems() async {
    final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
    
    // Load tracked items from Firestore
    final items = await _itemTracker.getAllTrackedItems(userId: user.uid);
    
    // Calculate total potential savings
    double savings = 0.0;
    for (final item in items) {
      if (item.purchases.length > 1) {
        final prices = item.purchases.map((p) => p.price).toList();
        final minPrice = prices.reduce((a, b) => a < b ? a : b);
        final maxPrice = prices.reduce((a, b) => a > b ? a : b);
        savings += (maxPrice - minPrice) * item.purchaseCount;
      }
    }
    
    setState(() {
      _trackedItems = items;
      _totalSavings = savings;
      _isLoading = false;
    });
  }

  Widget _buildItemCard(ItemPurchaseHistory item) {
    // Calculate trend and predictions
    final trend = _calculateTrend(item);
    final nextPurchase = _itemTracker.predictNextPurchase(item);
    final daysUntil = nextPurchase?.difference(DateTime.now()).inDays;
    
    return Card(
      child: Row(
        children: [
          // Category icon with emoji
          Container(
            child: Text(_getCategoryEmoji(item.category)),
          ),
          // Item info with predictions
          Expanded(
            child: Column(
              children: [
                Text(item.itemName),
                Text('${item.purchaseCount} purchases • Avg \${item.averagePrice.toStringAsFixed(2)}'),
                // Show prediction if within 7 days
                if (daysUntil != null && daysUntil <= 7)

                    style: /* orange if <=2 days, green otherwise */,
                  ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
          // Trend indicator
          if (trend != 'stable')
            Icon(trend == 'up' ? Icons.trending_up : Icons.trending_down),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  String _calculateTrend(ItemPurchaseHistory item) {
    if (item.purchases.length < 2) return 'stable';
    final sorted = item.purchases.toList()..sort((a, b) => a.date.compareTo(b.date));
    final change = ((sorted.last.price - sorted.first.price) / sorted.first.price) * 100;
    if (change > 10) return 'up';
    if (change < -10) return 'down';
    return 'stable';
  }
}
```

## 4. Errors and Fixes:

### Error 1: Tool Use Error - File Not Read
**Error**: When trying to edit `add_transaction_screen.dart`:
```
<error><tool_use_error>File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing to it.</tool_use_error>
```

**Fix**: Read the file first using the Read tool before attempting to edit it
```dart
<invoke name="Read">
<parameter name="file_path">d:\FinCoPilot\fin_copilot\lib\features\add_transaction\presentation\add_transaction_screen.dart</parameter>
</invoke>
```

**User Feedback**: None - this was a tool constraint I navigated around

### Error 2: Unused Import Warning
**Error**: Flutter analyzer found unused import:
```
warning - Unused import: 'dart:convert' - lib\services\agents\orchestrator_agent.dart:2:8
```

**Fix**: Removed the unused import from orchestrator_agent.dart

**User Feedback**: None - proactive cleanup

### Error 3: Deprecated Model Usage
**Error**: User identified: "you used Gemini 1.5 model which is retired model"

**Fix**: 
- Updated Receipt Agent from `gemini-1.5-pro` to `gemini-2.5-pro`
- Verified all other agents were already using `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Added web search to get latest model information

**User Feedback**: User explicitly requested model update and web search for latest info

## 5. Problem Solving:

### Problem 1: Conversational UI Not Working
**Issue**: Transaction preview cards weren't appearing, debug text showing instead, using regex instead of real AI

**Solution**: Created RobustAIService with:
- Proper Gemini 2.5 Flash integration
- Structured JSON response parsing
- System prompts enforcing required fields
- Intelligent fallback extraction

**Status**: ✅ Resolved - User confirmed "great, it is working"

### Problem 2: Scalability and Maintenance
**Issue**: Single AI model approach not scalable

**Solution**: Implemented 7-agent swarm architecture where each agent specializes in one task (extraction, validation, context analysis, etc.)

**Status**: ✅ Resolved - All 7 agents implemented and operational

### Problem 3: Camera Feature Not Enabled
**Issue**: Receipt upload suggestion working but camera button showed "coming soon"

**Solution**: 
- Implemented camera/gallery picker with ImagePicker
- Created Receipt Review Screen for user confirmation/editing
- Integrated Receipt Agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro Vision) for OCR
- Connected Item Tracker Agent to save confirmed items to Firestore

**Status**: ✅ Resolved - Full receipt flow working end-to-end

### Problem 4: Item Tracking Not Saving
**Issue**: Receipt items extracted but not being saved to Firestore

**Solution**: Modified `_processConfirmedReceipt` in add_transaction_screen.dart to call ItemTrackerAgent.trackItems() with user ID and receipt items

**Status**: ✅ Resolved - Items now saving to tracked_items and item_profiles collections

### Problem 5: Price Intelligence Dashboard Empty
**Issue**: Dashboard UI created but not loading real data

**Solution** (IN PROGRESS): 
- Added `getAllTrackedItems()` method to ItemTrackerAgent
- Implemented purchase prediction algorithm
- Updated dashboard to load from Firestore
- Calculating potential savings across stores
- Displaying predictions ("Need in X days")

**Status**: ⏳ In Progress - Loading logic implemented, was updating display methods when summary requested

## 6. All User Messages:

1. "We're continuing Phase B implementation of the Fin Co-Pilot redesign. Phase A (foundation) is complete: new theme, bottom navigation, hero dashboard, and FAB are all implemented and working. Current blocker: The conversational Add Transaction feature is not working correctly. It's showing debug text instead of proper chat UI, and transaction preview cards aren't appearing. The core issue is that we're using regex parsing instead of calling the Gemini AI properly. Immediate task: Implement the RobustAIService that connects to the existing GeminiOrchestratorService, uses the system prompt we designed, and returns structured JSON responses that the UI can render correctly. All the architecture and prompts are designed. We just need to implement it properly. The files exist but need the AI integration fixed. Reference the '13-Agent Swarm Architecture' section above for the complete system design. Start with agents 1-7 (transaction agents), then add 8-13 (location agents) later. The user wants to see the conversational UI working robustly with beautiful transaction preview cards appearing when all required fields are collected."

2. "great, it is working, let's do the next steps"

3. "Great, I did the Groceries $47" and the chat asked me to snap the recipt, but camera isn't enabled yet, it said coming soon in step 5.7. I think it is the time to enable it after enabling it and after user take the picture, the AI must view the items for the user to confirm or edit before submit"

4. "you used Gemini 1.5 model which is retiered model you must update all the models to Gemini 2.5 family there is Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, and Flash Lite search web to get updated info about those models. the next steps are : Connect Item Tracker Agent - Save items to Firestore Price Intelligence Dashboard - Show user their trends Purchase Predictions - 'You need milk in 2 days'"

5. "let's do the next steps 🚀"

## 7. Pending Tasks:

Based on user's explicit request "the next steps are":

1. **✅ COMPLETED**: Connect Item Tracker Agent - Save items to Firestore
   - Items now saving when receipts are confirmed
   - Item profiles being created/updated
   - Price history tracked

2. **⏳ IN PROGRESS**: Price Intelligence Dashboard - Show user their trends
   - Dashboard UI created
   - Data loading from Firestore implemented
   - Item cards displaying with predictions
   - Still need to complete: price trend charts, full item detail view

3. **⏳ PENDING**: Purchase Predictions - "You need milk in 2 days"
   - Prediction algorithm implemented (calculatePurchaseFrequency, predictNextPurchase)
   - Displaying "Need in X days" on item cards
   - Still need: notifications, proactive alerts

4. **⏳ PENDING**: Add price trend charts using fl_chart
   - Library already in pubspec.yaml
   - Need to create chart widgets showing price over time

5. **⏳ PENDING**: Add store comparison feature
   - Show which store has best price for each item
   - Calculate potential savings

## 8. Current Work:

**File Being Modified**: `lib/features/price_intelligence/presentation/price_intelligence_screen.dart`

**Specific Task**: Updating the Price Intelligence Dashboard to display real tracked items from Firestore with purchase predictions and price trends.

**What Was Just Completed**:
1. Updated `_loadTrackedItems()` to query Firestore using `ItemTrackerAgent.getAllTrackedItems()`
2. Implemented potential savings calculation by comparing min/max prices across purchases
3. Updated `_buildSummaryCards()` to show actual tracked item count and calculated savings
4. Rewrote `_buildItemCard()` to:
   - Display real ItemPurchaseHistory data
   - Show category emojis (🥛🥬🥩 etc.)
   - Calculate and display price trends (up/down/stable icons)
   - Show purchase predictions ("🔔 Need soon!" or "🔮 Need in X days")
   - Highlight urgent needs (orange if ≤2 days, green if 3-7 days)
5. Added `_calculateTrend()` helper method to determine if prices are increasing/decreasing/stable

**Where I Left Off**:
I was in the middle of updating the `_showItemDetail()` method and the item detail bottom sheet. The method signature was still referencing the old `ItemProfileSummary` type instead of the new `ItemPurchaseHistory` type:

```dart
void _showItemDetail(ItemProfileSummary item) {  // ← Still using old type
  showModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
    // ...
```

This needs to be changed to:
```dart
void _showItemDetail(ItemPurchaseHistory item) {  // ← Should use ItemPurchaseHistory
```

And the detail sheet needs to display:
- Full purchase history with dates
- Price trend chart (using fl_chart)
- Purchase frequency ("You buy this every X days")
- Next predicted purchase date
- Store comparison (best price at which merchant)

**Code Context** - Last modification made:
```dart
String _calculateTrend(ItemPurchaseHistory item) {
  if (item.purchases.length < 2) return 'stable';

  final sorted = item.purchases.toList()..sort((a, b) => a.date.compareTo(b.date));
  final oldestPrice = sorted.first.price;
  final latestPrice = sorted.last.price;
  final change = ((latestPrice - oldestPrice) / oldestPrice) * 100;

  if (change > 10) return 'up';
  if (change < -10) return 'down';
  return 'stable';
}

void _showItemDetail(ItemProfileSummary item) {  // ← THIS IS WHERE I STOPPED
  showModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
```

## 9. Optional Next Step:

**Direct Quote from User**: "let's do the next steps 🚀"

**Context**: The "next steps" explicitly stated by user were:
1. ✅ Connect Item Tracker Agent - Save items to Firestore (DONE)
2. ⏳ Price Intelligence Dashboard - Show user their trends (IN PROGRESS)
3. ⏳ Purchase Predictions - "You need milk in 2 days" (PARTIALLY DONE - predictions calculating and displaying)

**Next Immediate Step**: Complete the Price Intelligence Dashboard by:

1. **Fix the `_showItemDetail()` method signature and implementation**:
```dart
void _showItemDetail(ItemPurchaseHistory item) {  // Change from ItemProfileSummary
  showModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
    isScrollControlled: true,
    builder: (context) => _buildItemDetailSheet(item),
  );
}

Widget _buildItemDetailSheet(ItemPurchaseHistory item) {
  final trend = _itemTracker.getPriceTrend(userId: user.uid, itemName: item.itemName);
  final nextPurchase = _itemTracker.predictNextPurchase(item);
  final frequency = _itemTracker.calculatePurchaseFrequency(item.purchases);
  
  return DraggableScrollableSheet(
    builder: (context, scrollController) {
      return SingleChildScrollView(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Item name header
            Text(item.itemName),
            
            // Stats section
            _buildStatRow('Purchase Count', '${item.purchaseCount}'),
            _buildStatRow('Average Price', '\${item.averagePrice.toStringAsFixed(2)}'),
            _buildStatRow('Last Price', '\${item.lastPrice.toStringAsFixed(2)}'),
            _buildStatRow('Frequency', frequency != null ? 'Every $frequency days' : 'N/A'),
            if (nextPurchase != null)
              _buildStatRow('Next Purchase', _formatDate(nextPurchase)),
            
            // Price history chart (to be implemented with fl_chart)
            _buildPriceChart(item.purchases),
            
            // Purchase history list
            _buildPurchaseHistory(item.purchases),
            
            // Store comparison
            _buildStoreComparison(item.purchases),
          ],
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

2. **Then add price trend chart using fl_chart**:
```dart
Widget _buildPriceChart(List<ItemPurchase> purchases) {
  return Container(
    height: 200,
    child: LineChart(
      LineChartData(
        lineBarsData: [
          LineChartBarData(
            spots: purchases.asMap().entries.map((e) {
              return FlSpot(e.key.toDouble(), e.value.price);
            }).toList(),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

This directly continues the work that was in progress when the summary was requested - making the Price Intelligence Dashboard fully functional with real data, trends, and predictions as explicitly requested by the user..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
