## 📱 Device Testing

### Android Testing
- [ ] Test on Android 8+ (notification channels)
- [ ] Test notification permissions request
- [ ] Test background notification delivery
- [ ] Test notification sound and vibration
- [ ] Test notification actions and interactions

### iOS Testing
- [ ] Test on iOS 10+ (rich notifications)
- [ ] Test notification permissions request
- [ ] Test background notification delivery
- [ ] Test notification sound and badges
- [ ] Test notification actions and interactions

## 🔍 Monitoring Setup

### Firebase Console Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Cloud Function execution logs
- [ ] Check FCM delivery statistics
- [ ] Monitor Firestore read/write operations
- [ ] Set up error alerting for functions

### App Analytics
- [ ] Track notification open rates
- [ ] Monitor user engagement with notifications
- [ ] Track notification settings usage
- [ ] Monitor error rates and crashes

## 🔐 Security Verification

### Firestore Rules Testing
- [ ] Test user can only access their own notifications
- [ ] Test user can only modify their own FCM tokens
- [ ] Test public collections are read-only
- [ ] Test unauthenticated access is blocked

### Data Privacy
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in notification content
- [ ] Verify FCM tokens are properly secured
- [ ] Verify user notification preferences are private
- [ ] Verify notification history is user-specific

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Firebase Functions Issues
- **Issue**: Function deployment fails
- **Solution**: Check Node.js version compatibility (requires Node 18)
- **Command**: `node --version` then `nvm use 18` if needed

### FCM Token Issues
- **Issue**: FCM token not received
- **Solution**: Check network connectivity and Firebase project configuration
- **Debug**: Enable Firebase debug logging

### Notification Display Issues
- **Issue**: Notifications not showing
- **Solution**: Check notification permissions and channel configuration
- **Debug**: Test with local notifications first

### Android Notification Channel Issues
- **Issue**: Notifications not respecting channel settings
- **Solution**: Ensure channels are created before sending notifications
- **Debug**: Check Android notification settings for the app

### iOS Background Notification Issues
- **Issue**: Notifications not received in background
- **Solution**: Verify background modes in Info.plist
- **Debug**: Test with device connected to Xcode console
