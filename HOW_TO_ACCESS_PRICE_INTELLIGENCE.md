## 📊 Chart Requirements

### To see a price trend chart for an item:

✅ **Minimum**: Item must have been purchased **2 or more times**
✅ **Recommended**: 3-5+ purchases for better trend visualization

### Example:
```
Milk 🥛
  ├─ Purchase 1: $3.99 at Walmart (Oct 1)
  ├─ Purchase 2: $4.29 at Target (Oct 8)
  └─ Purchase 3: $3.89 at Walmart (Oct 15)
  
  Result: Chart shows upward trend from $3.99 → $4.29
          Then down to $3.89 (GREEN line = decreasing overall)
```
