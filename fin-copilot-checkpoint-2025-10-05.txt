# Checkpoint — Fin Co-Pilot Alpha — October 5, 2025, 14:15

## Summary

Building **Fin Co-Pilot**, an AI-powered personal finance mobile app using Flutter + Firebase + Gemini AI multi-agent swarm architecture. **Phase 1 is 89% complete** (8 of 9 milestones done). The app currently has: authentication, onboarding with auto-currency detection, transaction logging via text/voice/receipt photo, AI-powered transaction classification, multi-currency support, insights dashboard with charts, and AI-generated financial analysis. Currently pausing to create app icon using Google's Imagen/Gemini image generation ("Nano Banana"), then implement splash screen before addressing minor bugs and polishing for alpha testing.

## Key Facts & Configuration

**Tech Stack:**
- Flutter (mobile app) + Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Vertex AI)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash (Orchestrator Agent)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (Receipt Parser, Transaction Classifier)
- Gemini 2.5 Pro (Financial Analyst for insights)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image / Imagen 3 (for app icon generation)

**Project Structure:**
```
lib/
├── core/ (config, constants, utils)
├── features/ (auth, onboarding, dashboard, transactions, insights, settings)
├── services/ (auth, transaction, insights, orchestrator, agents)
└── shared/ (models, widgets)
```

**Key Files:**
- `lib/services/gemini_orchestrator_service.dart` - AI routing logic
- `lib/services/receipt_parser_agent.dart` - OCR from photos
- `lib/services/transaction_classifier_agent.dart` - NLP categorization
- `lib/services/insights_service.dart` - Analytics generation
- `lib/shared/models/transaction.dart` - Transaction data model
- `lib/core/utils/currency_utils.dart` - Multi-currency formatting

**Firebase Project:** `fin-co-pilot-v2`

**Supported Features:**
- Text, voice, and receipt photo transaction input
- Auto-categorization (groceries, dining, transport, entertainment, shopping, health, bills, education, travel)
- Multi-currency (USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, TRY, etc. - auto-detected from device locale)
- Monthly insights with pie charts and AI recommendations
- Transaction filtering by category

## Assumptions & Constraints

**Design Decisions:**
- Currency switching **disabled for alpha** (kept code commented out) - each user has one currency set at onboarding
- App targets global market (any country, any currency, any language)
- Freemium model planned: Free tier (3 months history, 50 transactions/month) + Premium ($4.99/month)
- Phase 1 = Alpha MVP for initial testing (not Beta yet)
- Cost optimization: Use cheapest Gemini model per task (Flash-Lite for simple, Pro for complex)

**Budget/Costs:**
- Currently on Firebase free tier + Vertex AI pay-as-you-go
- GCP budget alerts set at $500/month threshold
- Estimated cost: ~$0.78/month per 1000 transactions (vs $7.00 for single-agent approach)

**Development Environment:**
- VS Code + Claude Sonnet 4.5 (primary development tool)
- Flutter SDK installed and configured
- Physical Android device recommended for voice input testing

## Open Tasks & Next Steps

1. **APP ICON GENERATION**:
   - Use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) API to generate app icon
   - Prompt suggestions below
   - Export as 1024x1024 PNG
   - Add to Flutter project (`android/app/src/main/res/` and `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/`)

2. **SPLASH SCREEN**:
   - Create splash screen with app logo
   - Configure for iOS and Android
   - Add loading animation

3. **BUG FIXES & POLISH** (User reported minor issues to address):
   - Review and fix small bugs identified during testing
   - Polish UI inconsistencies
   - Test edge cases

4. **M9: BETA LAUNCH PREP**:
   - Privacy policy page
   - Terms of service page
   - App Store descriptions
   - TestFlight/Firebase App Distribution setup

5. **ALPHA TESTING**:
   - Deploy to Firebase App Distribution
   - Invite 10-20 alpha testers
   - Collect feedback
   - Iterate based on user input

## Transition Prompt for New Chat

Hi Claude, I'm continuing development of **Fin Co-Pilot**, an AI-powered personal finance mobile app. We're at **89% completion of Phase 1 (Alpha MVP)**. The app uses Flutter + Firebase + Gemini AI with a multi-agent swarm architecture (Orchestrator, Receipt Parser, Transaction Classifier, Financial Analyst agents).

**Current state:** All core features working - users can add transactions via text/voice/receipt photo, view categorized spending, see insights with charts, and get AI-generated financial advice. Multi-currency support implemented. We just completed M8 (Insights & Analytics).

**What we need now:**
1. Generate an app icon using **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** (the "Nano Banana" model) - research confirmed it's perfect for this (supports text-to-image, high quality, available via Vertex AI and Gemini API)
2. Implement splash screen
3. Fix minor bugs user identified
4. Complete M9 for alpha launch

**Important context:**
- User prefers "partner" working style - collaborative, direct, no excessive praise
- Project charter document attached contains full architecture details
- Currency switching is disabled for alpha (code preserved but commented out)
- Turkish Lira (TRY) support recently added
- User is well-rested and ready to continue building

**Please:**
- Provide prompts for generating a clean, modern fintech app icon using Gemini image generation
- Guide splash screen implementation step-by-step
- Maintain the same technical depth and hands-on coding approach

The user is energized and wants to keep building. Let's finish strong!

## Recent Decision Log

**Major Decisions:**
- **Currency Strategy:** Simplified to auto-detect only (no manual switching) to avoid conversion complexity in alpha
- **Agent Architecture:** Confirmed multi-agent swarm (cost savings + modularity)
- **Model Selection:** Flash-Lite for simple tasks, Flash for medium, Pro for complex analysis
- **Turkish Lira:** Added TRY support with ₺ symbol for Turkish market
- **Image Generation:** Confirmed Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) is ideal for app icon - top-rated, supports text-to-image, available now

**Recent Milestones Completed:**
- M6: Voice input with speech-to-text (working perfectly on device)
- M7: Multi-currency system with Turkish Lira support
- M8: Insights dashboard with pie charts, category breakdown, top merchants, and AI-generated financial insights powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro

**Current Status:** User tested insights screen, AI generated 3 excellent recommendations (identified "Unknown" merchants issue, flagged 82% transport spending, noted high average transaction). Charts rendering beautifully. Ready to finalize visual assets (icon + splash) before alpha launch prep.
